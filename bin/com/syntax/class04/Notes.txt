Type casting (primitive data types):
    type casting is converting one data type to another one.
    For example we can convert a short to byte a long to float etc.
    There are two main types implicit/widening/automatic and explicit/narrowing/Manual implicit/widening
    automatic Type casting:
    when java converts the data types automatically for us. It only happens when we assign a smaller
    data type to a larger data type, because there is no data loss in this Conversion.

Explicit/narrowing/manual Type casting:
    When we convert a larger data type to smaller data type it is called 
    Explicit/narrowing/Manual. it does not happen automatically we have to do it explicitly Manually.
Why we should learn type casting?
    when we write code in our  real life most of the time we use the code our code compatible with their code
What is the syntax for type casting?
    we use () and inside the () we write the destination data type for example
    long var1=250; 
    int var2=(int)var1; //its Explicit/narrowing/Manual
    double var3=var2    //implicit/widening/automatic

if else conditions
    if else conditions help us write code that can take the decision based on data.
why we should learn about if else?
    Because when we are solving a real life problem like testing a web site our programs need to
    make a lot of decision.
    if (the given user name and password matches)
    {go to home page} Else {give user a warning}
    
    if (video freezing) {
    System.out.println ("stop video") }
    else
    {
    System.out.print("keep video") }
    
What is the syntax for if else conditions
    boolean isHungry=true;
    
    if(isHungry) {
         
    }
